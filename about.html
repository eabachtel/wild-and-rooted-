                <p>About Wild & Rooted</p>
                <p>Hi, I’m Liz, and I started Wild & Rooted from my love of plants and the joy they bring to life.</p> 
                <p>I believe that plants can transform any space, making it feel alive, calm, and full of potential.</p> 
                <p>Wild & Rooted is a small, heart-driven business, and each plant cutting I prepare is grown and nurtured with love.</p> 
                <p>It’s my mission to make plant care simple, rewarding, and accessible for everyone.</p>
                <p>Thank you for letting me be a part of your green journey, and I hope Wild & Rooted brings a touch of nature’s peace to your home.</p>

                <h3>Dedication</h3>
                <p>I dedicate this adventure to Ray for their unwavering support and encouragement. Thank you for believing in me when I didn't believe in myself.</p>
                <p>A special thanks to my wonderful daughter, who inspires me every day to reach for my dreams and who reminds me of the strength in nurturing growth.</p>
