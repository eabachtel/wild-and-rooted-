            <section class="about-text">
                <p>Hi, I’m Liz, the founder of Wild & Rooted! I started this business to share my love for plants and help others bring nature’s beauty into their homes.</p>
                <p>Wild & Rooted was born out of a passion for nurturing life and sharing nature’s gifts with others. Each plant we offer is carefully grown with love and respect, embodying our mission to make plant care accessible to all.</p>

                <h3>Dedication</h3>
                <p>I dedicate this adventure to Ray for their unwavering support and encouragement. Thank you for believing in me when I didn't believe in myself.</p>
                <p>A special thanks to my wonderful daughter, who inspires me every day to reach for my dreams and who reminds me of the strength in nurturing growth.
             <p>I hope Wild & Rooted empowers others, to cultivate resilience and joy in every space.</p>
