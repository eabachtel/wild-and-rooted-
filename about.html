        <h2>About Wild & Rooted</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Liz, the founder of Wild & Rooted. As a lifelong plant enthusiast and IT technician by day, I started this business with a mission to make plant care accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable for everyone.</p>
        <p>Wild & Rooted is dedicated to offering high-quality plant clippings along with easy-to-follow care tips. Each plant is selected for its unique beauty and ability to thrive indoors, helping to bring the calming, vibrant presence of nature into your home.</p>
        <p>Thank you for joining me on this green journey, and I hope our plants help you create a peaceful, rooted space of your own.</p>
